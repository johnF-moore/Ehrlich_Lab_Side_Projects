- *perinatal_modeling.qmd* has spline regression code to understand how gene expression changes in different cell types from newborn mice to 1 month old mice. (See first example image below.)

- *T-ALL_flowSOM_clustering.py* has some code to cluster flow cytometry data. I actually wrote this script for an undergraduate to use. (See second example image below.)
